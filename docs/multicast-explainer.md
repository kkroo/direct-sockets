## What is Multicast?
Multicast sockets are a way of one to many network communication. It is possible only for UDP datagram packets to be sent to a multicast group, and all subscribers would receive it.

In IPv4, any address between 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 can be used as a multicast address.
In IPv6 multicast addresses, the first 8 bits are all ones, i.e. FF00::/8. Further, bit 113-116 represents the scope of the address, which can be either one of the following 4: Global, Site-local, Link-local, Node-local.

### Any-Source Multicast (ASM) vs Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)

There are two models for IP multicast:

**Any-Source Multicast (ASM)** is the traditional multicast model where receivers join a multicast group and receive traffic from any source sending to that group. This is simpler but provides less control over which sources can send to the group.

**Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)** allows receivers to specify not only the multicast group they want to join, but also the specific source address from which they want to receive traffic. This provides:
- **Better security**: Receivers only accept traffic from explicitly specified sources, reducing the risk of unwanted or malicious traffic.
- **Simplified routing**: Routers don't need to maintain state for all possible sources, making the routing infrastructure more efficient.
- **Denial-of-service protection**: Attackers cannot inject traffic into a multicast stream without knowing the expected source address.

By convention, the SSM address range is 232.0.0.0/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) for IPv4 and ff3x::/32 (where x is the scope) for IPv6. However, this API does not enforce SSM-specific address ranges — any valid multicast address can be used with a source filter. The SSM ranges are reserved by IANA and recommended for SSM deployments, but not required.

Node-Local
: Same device

Link-Local 
: This scope confines packets to the local network segment or link. This means the packet will reach all multicast listeners on the same physical or logical network (like a single Ethernet LAN or Wi-Fi network), but it will not be forwarded by routers to other network segments. This is commonly used for service discovery and autoconfiguration protocols, such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).

Site-local
: This scope is larger than link-local. It is intended for use within a specific site or organization. Packets sent with this scope can be forwarded by routers, but they should not leave the boundaries of the organization's network. This is useful for enterprise-wide services where you want to reach all nodes within a company's network but prevent the traffic from leaking onto the public internet.

Global
: The whole world.

## Use cases

1. Synchronous video stream from one device to the whole network of devices. For example, imagine in a shopping mall there would be multiple displays which show videos simultaneously on all devices.
2. Device discovery on a local network. mDNS protocol uses multicast sockets under the hood. In short, when a device joins a network, it sends a message: “Hello, I am headphones-10, my ip is ‘20.20.20.14’ . Who else is here?”, other devices reply and in such a manner all devices can know about each other without a central server.

## Similar functionality

ChromeApp API [sockets.udp](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/reference/sockets/udp) already has support for all necessary functions for multicast socket. The proposal is basically to port those API’s to [Isolated Web Apps](https://github.com/WICG/isolated-web-apps/blob/main/README.md).
The reason why it is restricted to Isolated Web Apps is because it is part of the Direct Sockets API which is also restricted to Isolated Web Apps. More about threats can be found in [Direct Sockets explainer](https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets/blob/main/docs/explainer.md), in short, this API is considered high-risk primarily because it allows unencrypted, unsecured connection via arbitrary protocols (which might have vulnerabilities) and, more importantly, enables web applications to interact with (and potentially control) devices on private networks.

## Permissions Policy integration

This specification defines a policy-controlled permission identified by the string `direct-sockets-multicast`.

```
Permissions-Policy: direct-sockets-multicast=(self)
```
This [`Permissions-Policy`](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5745992911552512) header determines whether 
`multicastController.joinGroup()`, `multicastController.leaveGroup()` call or providing multicast params to
`new UDPSocket(..)` immediately rejects with SecurityError.

* In a similar fashion, Apple requires that apps with multicast declare [multicast entitlment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.networking.multicast). 

## Sending datagrams example

Everything is very similar to how `UDPSocket` is used to send data to a remote. The only difference is additional options to control multicast behavior.

```javascript
// Params that sender and receiver are agreed upon.
var PORT = 12345;
var MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR = "239.0.0.1";

// Can be bound or connected socket as you like.
// This is example of connected one.
const socket = new UDPSocket({
    remoteAddress: MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR,
    remotePort: PORT,
    // How much network hops are allowed until the packet is discarded.
    multicastTimeToLive: 5,
    // For debug purposes, send this datagram also back to this machine.
    multicastLoopback: true
});

const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const { writable, remoteAddress, remotePort, localAddress, localPort } = await socket.opened;

const writer = writable.getWriter();
await writer.ready;

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { 
    await writer.write({data: encoder.encode(`message from CLIENT = ${i}`)});
}

writer.releaseLock();
await reader.cancel();
await socket.close();
```

## Receiving datagrams example (Any-Source Multicast)

```javascript
// Params that sender and receiver are agreed upon.
var PORT = 12345;
var MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR = "239.0.0.1";
// This must be bound socket. Cannot be connected.
const socket = new UDPSocket({
    // This address acts as a filter in case of multicast.
    localAddress: '0.0.0.0',
    // The port must be same as remotePort in sender.
    localPort: PORT,
    // Other multicast options are only for sender.
    multicastAllowAddressSharing: true
});

const { readable, multicastController } = await socket.opened;

await multicastController.joinGroup(MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR);

for (group of multicastController.joinedGroups) {
   console.log("joined multicast group=" + group);
}

const reader = readable.getReader()
readStream(reader, (message) => {
    const messageStr = decoder.decode(message.data);
    console.log('processing response= ' + messageStr);
});

// stop execution after reading messages for 5s.
await delay(5000);

await reader.cancel();
// Not necessary. The socket will leave all joined groups on calling close.
await multicastController.leaveGroup(MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR);
await socket.close();


export async function readStream(
  reader, // :ReadableStreamDefaultReader
  cb, // : (value: Uint8Array) => void
) {
  // Read from the socket until it's closed
  while (reader) {
    // Wait for the next chunk
    const { value, done } = await reader.read();

    // Send the chunk to the callback
    if (value) {
      cb(value);
    }

    // Release the reader if we're done
    if (done) {
      console.log('readStream finish');
      reader.releaseLock();
      break;
    }
  }
}

function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

## Receiving datagrams example (Source-Specific Multicast)

Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) allows you to receive multicast traffic only from a specific source address. This is useful when you want to ensure that traffic comes from a trusted sender.

```javascript
// Params that sender and receiver are agreed upon.
var PORT = 12345;
// SSM addresses are in the 232.0.0.0/8 range for IPv4
var MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR = "232.1.1.1";
// The specific source we want to receive from
var SOURCE_ADDR = "192.0.2.100";

// This must be bound socket. Cannot be connected.
const socket = new UDPSocket({
    localAddress: '0.0.0.0',
    localPort: PORT,
    multicastAllowAddressSharing: true
});

const { readable, multicastController } = await socket.opened;

// Join the multicast group with a specific source address (SSM)
await multicastController.joinGroup(MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR, {
    sourceAddress: SOURCE_ADDR
});

// joinedGroups now returns MulticastMembership objects for SSM memberships
for (const membership of multicastController.joinedGroups) {
    if (typeof membership === 'string') {
        // ASM membership (group address only)
        console.log("joined ASM group=" + membership);
    } else {
        // SSM membership (MulticastMembership object)
        console.log("joined SSM group=" + membership.groupAddress +
                    " from source=" + membership.sourceAddress);
    }
}

const reader = readable.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

readStream(reader, (message) => {
    const messageStr = decoder.decode(message.data);
    console.log('processing response from ' + SOURCE_ADDR + ': ' + messageStr);
});

// stop execution after reading messages for 5s.
await delay(5000);

await reader.cancel();
// Leave the SSM group - must specify the same source address
await multicastController.leaveGroup(MULTICAST_GROUP_ADDR, {
    sourceAddress: SOURCE_ADDR
});
await socket.close();

export async function readStream(
  reader, // :ReadableStreamDefaultReader
  cb, // : (value: Uint8Array) => void
) {
  // Read from the socket until it's closed
  while (reader) {
    const { value, done } = await reader.read();
    if (value) {
      cb(value);
    }
    if (done) {
      console.log('readStream finish');
      reader.releaseLock();
      break;
    }
  }
}

function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

## IDL Definitions

### UDPSocketOptions
```java
dictionary UDPSocketOptions : SocketOptions {
  .. // old fields.
  [EnforceRange] octet multicastTimeToLive;
  boolean multicastLoopback;
  boolean multicastAllowAddressSharing;
};
```

* **multicastAllowAddressSharing** - Whether address reuse is allowed.
This comes in handy for device discovery use cases. When multiple applications need to listen to the same address and port to be able to catch messages that a new device has joined the network.<br>
Value can only be provided if the app has permission to use Multicast subscribing.<br>
The default is false.<br>
It corresponds to SO_REUSEADDR / SO_REUSEPORT in Unix.

* **multicastTimeToLive** - This option controls how far your multicast packets can travel across a network. Each time a packet passes through a router, its TTL value is decremented. If the TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded.<br>
The default is 1.<br>
It corresponds to IP_MULTICAST_TTL / IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS in Unix.

* **multicastLoopback** - Sets whether multicast packets sent from the host to the multicast group will be looped back to the host.<br>
The default is true.<br>
Note: the behavior of loopback is slightly different between Windows and Unix-like systems. The inconsistency happens only when there is more than one application on the same host joined to the same multicast group while having different settings on multicast loopback mode. On Windows, the applications with loopback off will not RECEIVE the loopback packets; while on Unix-like systems, the applications with loopback off will not SEND the loopback packets to other applications on the same host. See [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/ip-multicast-2).
It corresponds to IP_MULTICAST_LOOP / IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP in Unix.


### MulticastGroupOptions

```java
dictionary MulticastGroupOptions {
  DOMString sourceAddress;
};
```

* **sourceAddress** (optional) - The IP address of the source for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM). When provided, the socket will only receive multicast packets from this specific source. The source address must be a valid unicast IP address and must match the IP version (IPv4 or IPv6) of the group address.

### MulticastMembership

```java
dictionary MulticastMembership {
  required DOMString groupAddress;
  DOMString sourceAddress;
};
```

* **groupAddress** - The multicast group IP address (IPv4: 224.0.0.0/4 or IPv6: ff00::/8).
* **sourceAddress** (optional) - The source IP address for SSM memberships. Present only for Source-Specific Multicast memberships.

### MulticastController

```java
dictionary UDPSocketOpenInfo : SocketOpenInfo {
  MulticastController multicastController;
};

[
    Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker, SharedWorker, ServiceWorker),
    SecureContext,
    IsolatedContext
]
interface MulticastController {

  Promise<undefined> joinGroup(
      DOMString ipAddress,
      optional MulticastGroupOptions options = {});
  Promise<undefined> leaveGroup(
      DOMString ipAddress,
      optional MulticastGroupOptions options = {});

  readonly attribute FrozenArray<(DOMString or MulticastMembership)> joinedGroups;
};
```
* **MulticastController** is an object returned if the app has permission to use Multicast subscribing.

* **joinGroup(DOMString ipAddress, optional MulticastGroupOptions options)**<br>
Joins the multicast group and starts to receive packets from that group. The socket must be bound to a local port before calling this method.<br>
The ipAddress param must be a valid multicast IP address, not a domain name. Otherwise TypeError is thrown.<br>
If `options.sourceAddress` is provided, this creates a Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) membership. The sourceAddress must be a valid unicast IP address matching the IP version of the ipAddress. Otherwise TypeError is thrown.<br>
Duplicate memberships (same ipAddress and sourceAddress combination) are not allowed and will result in an InvalidStateError DOMException.<br>
Mixing ASM and SSM memberships for the same group address is not allowed. If an ASM membership already exists for the group, attempting to join with a sourceAddress will result in an InvalidStateError DOMException, and vice versa.<br>
The function returns a promise, which resolves with undefined in case of success. In case of a network error, the promise is rejected with a NetworkError DOMException. The message property may contain an implementation-defined string describing the error condition in more detail.<br>
Corresponds to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP / IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP for ASM, or MCAST_JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP for SSM in Unix.


* **leaveGroup(DOMString ipAddress, optional MulticastGroupOptions options)**<br>
Leaves the multicast group previously joined using joinGroup. This is only necessary to call if you plan to keep using the socket afterwards, since clean up of resources will be done automatically by the OS when the socket is closed.
Leaving the group will prevent the router from sending multicast datagrams to the local host, presuming no other process on the host is still joined to the group.<br>
The ipAddress param must be a valid multicast IP address, not a domain name. Otherwise TypeError is thrown.<br>
For SSM memberships, you must provide the same `options.sourceAddress` that was used when joining. Otherwise the membership will not be found.<br>
The function returns a promise, which resolves with undefined in case of success. In case of a network error, the promise is rejected with a NetworkError DOMException. The message property may contain an implementation-defined string describing the error condition in more detail.<br>
Corresponds to IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP / IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP for ASM, or MCAST_LEAVE_SOURCE_GROUP for SSM in Unix.

* **FrozenArray<(DOMString or MulticastMembership)> joinedGroups**<br>
Gets the multicast group memberships the socket is currently joined to. The groups that are in process of joining are not returned.<br>
For Any-Source Multicast (ASM) memberships, returns the group address as a DOMString.<br>
For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) memberships, returns a MulticastMembership object containing both the groupAddress and sourceAddress.


## Which network interface will it use?

It is not planned to add an ability to pick which network interface to use. It would complicate the API.
Besides, right now there’s no way to get a networking interface ip address (in chrome apps, it was possible with https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/reference/system/network).
The [sockets.udp](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/reference/sockets/udp) API also does not give an ability to use a specific networking interface.

For the reference, the C unix API gives such options: 
```c
group.imr_interface.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
```

Direct Sockets implementations should set `group.imr_interface.s_addr` to `INADDR_ANY`
which lets the OS pick the current active network interface.


## Security considerations

> This API gives the opportunity to flood the network with packets.

By only providing this API to Isolated Web Apps the user agent can be more confident that the application has not been compromised. This allows users and system administrators to confidently grant this capability to trusted applications.

Additionally, routers have control, whether they send multicast packets or drop them. In many setups dropping multicast packets is the default setting.

## Privacy considerations
The API allows an application to list all devices on a private network if they use a device discovery protocol like mDNS. This can be used for fingerprinting.
